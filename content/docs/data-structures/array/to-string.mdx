title: toString()
description: Converts array to a string
---

## Basics

- Usually just removes the outer brackets, with elements separated by commas
- No real use case for this one (I think, could just use split for more control)

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 'a', '1a'];

console.log(array1.toString());
// Expected output: "1,2,a,1a"
```
