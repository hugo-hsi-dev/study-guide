title: sort()
description: Sorts an array
---

## Basics

- The callback function is optional
- If none is provided, it will convert elements into strings and comparing them baseed on UTF-16 values
- Sorted in ascending order by default
- If you need more granular control, use the cb function
- Returns a reference to the original array, except that it is now sorted
- No copy is made, sorts the array in place

## Usage

```js
const months = ['March', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Dec'];
months.sort();
console.log(months);
// Expected output: Array ["Dec", "Feb", "Jan", "March"]

const array1 = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
array1.sort();
console.log(array1);
// Expected output: Array [1, 100000, 21, 30, 4]
```

## Arguments

- CB function has two Arguments
- a, and b, both pointing towards elements in the array
- a is the first element to compare
- b is the second
- The CB function should return back a number
- Negative indicates a should be before b
- Positive indicates a should be after b
- Zero means they are equal
  <Callout title='To remember a and b'>
    ```js (a, b) => a - b``` sorts numbers in ascending order.
  </Callout>
