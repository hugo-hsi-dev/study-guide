title: toLocaleString()
description: Converting date objects
---

## Basics

- Converts each element into a string and transformed using their locale string methods, such as for dates
- The result is not an array, rather it is a single string separated by their local string separator, such as a comma

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [1, 'a', new Date('21 Dec 1997 14:12:00 UTC')];
const localeString = array1.toLocaleString('en', { timeZone: 'UTC' });

console.log(localeString);
// Expected output: "1,a,12/21/1997, 2:12:00 PM",
// This assumes "en" locale and UTC timezone - your results may vary
```
