title: copyWithin()
description: Copies a segment of an array into a new array
---

## Basics

- You can select the copy to location, as well as the start and end of the array
- Does not alter the length of the array
- Returns the resulting array

## Arguments

```js
copyWithin(target, start);
copyWithin(target, start, end);
```

- target is the starting location of where to insert the copied elements
- start is the starting index of where to copy elements from
- end is the ending position (optional)

## Example

```js
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

// Copy to index 0 the element at index 3
console.log(array1.copyWithin(0, 3, 4));
// Expected output: Array ["d", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

// Copy to index 1 all elements from index 3 to the end
console.log(array1.copyWithin(1, 3));
// Expected output: Array ["d", "d", "e", "d", "e"]
```

- Note how the second example repeats 'e' and 'd'
- This is how the method prevents altering the length of the array
