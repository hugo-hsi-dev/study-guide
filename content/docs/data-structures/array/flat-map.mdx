title: flatMap()
description: Map through a function and flatten afterwards
---

## Basics

- Same as mapping through an array followed by flattening
- More performant than using map and flat separately
- Returns the resulting array

## Usage

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 1];

const result = arr1.flatMap((num) => (num === 2 ? [2, 2] : 1));

console.log(result);
// Expected output: Array [1, 2, 2, 1]
```
