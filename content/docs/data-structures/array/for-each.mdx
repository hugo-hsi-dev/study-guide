## Basics

- Takes in a callback function
- CB function doesn't need to return anything, won't be used by the method
- Method returns undefined

## Usage

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach((element) => console.log(element));

// Expected output: "a"
// Expected output: "b"
// Expected output: "c"
```
