- Takes in callback function
- cb function return true if you want to return that value
- cb function return false if you want to continue searching

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [5, 12, 50, 130, 44];

const found = array1.findLast((element) => element > 45);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: 130
```
