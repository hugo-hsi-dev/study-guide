## Basics

- Arrays are resizable and can contain different types
- Accessed using zero based index
- Last element has -1 index, but can't be used with square bracket notation. Instead, use Array.at(-1)
- Usually are initialized like

```js title="Using brackets to initialize an array"
const array = [2, 4, 8];
```

but can also be created like

```js title="Using the array constructor"
const array = new Array(2, 4, 8);
// or
const array = Array(2, 4, 8);
```

these two options give identical results.

<Callout title='Interesting fact'>
  Using with or without 'new' gives the same results

## Quirks

- Can also use string notation such as

```js title="Using strings as indices"
years[2] === years['2'];
```

- Array's length increases automatically as items are added

```js title="Removing elements by setting length"
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]
numbers.length = 2;
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2]
```
