title: entries()
description: Creating a new array iterator from an array
---

## Basics

- An iterator object is one where a next() method is attached
- The next method returns a resulting object
- In this case, this resulting object has value and done
- We can call value to get a 2 length array where the first element is the index and second is the value

## Usage

```js
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

// Copy to index 0 the element at index 3
console.log(array1.copyWithin(0, 3, 4));
// Expected output: Array ["d", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

// Copy to index 1 all elements from index 3 to the end
console.log(array1.copyWithin(1, 3));
// Expected output: Array ["d", "d", "e", "d", "e"]
```

## Practical Example

You can spread out the index and element when calling entries() and use them as you see fit

```js
const a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (const [index, element] of a.entries()) {
  console.log(index, element);
}

// 0 'a'
// 1 'b'
// 2 'c'
```

## TLDR

This is somewhat of a niche method, good to know but probably not going to use in frontend.
