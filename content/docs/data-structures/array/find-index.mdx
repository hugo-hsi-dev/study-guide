title: findIndex()
description: Find the index of an element based on a callback function
---

## Basics

- Takes in a callback function that returns a boolean
- Return true if you want the index of that element
- Return false will continue iterating
- Will only find one/the first element
- If none are found, returns -1

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: 12
```
