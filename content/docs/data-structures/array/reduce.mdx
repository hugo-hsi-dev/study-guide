title: reduce()
description: Transforms the array into a single value given a cb function
---

## Basics

- Takes in a cb function that has two Arguments
- accumulator is the value that is kept between loops
- currentValue is the value in the array in this current loop
- The method also has a second argument, that being the initial value

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
const initialValue = 0;
const sumWithInitial = array1.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  initialValue
);

console.log(sumWithInitial);
// Expected output: 10
```

<Callout
  type='error'
  title='Careful!'
>
  If the array has no elements and there is no initial value given, a type error
  will be thrown
</Callout>
