title: fromAsync()
description: Creating arrays from promises
---

## Basics

- Like Array.from(), but the mapFn can return a promise.
- The promise will be awaited before being added to the resulting array
- Returns the new array

## Arguments

```js
const promiseArray = Array.fromAsync(iterable, asyncFunction, thisArg);
```

- iterable is the input
- asyncFunction runs for each element in the iterable, and returns a promise
- thisArg is the value of 'this' in the asyncFunction
