title: lastIndexOf()
description: Finding the last index element can be found in an array
---

## Basics

- Loops through in reverse order, searching from the last element
- Finds the index of a given known value
- If the value is not found in the array, -1 is returned
- Returns the index of the value

## Usage

```js
const animals = ['Dodo', 'Tiger', 'Penguin', 'Dodo'];

console.log(animals.lastIndexOf('Dodo'));
// Expected output: 3

console.log(animals.lastIndexOf('Tiger'));
// Expected output: 1
```
