title: push()
description: Adds an element to the end of an array
---

## Basics

- Takes in a value which will be added to the end of the array
- Doesn't return the resulting array, instead returning the new length
- Can also take in multiple values, which will be added in the order they were given

## Usage

```js
const animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];

const count = animals.push('cows');
console.log(count);
// Expected output: 4
console.log(animals);
// Expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]

animals.push('chickens', 'cats', 'dogs');
console.log(animals);
// Expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows", "chickens", "cats", "dogs"]
```
