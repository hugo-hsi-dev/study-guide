title: slice()
description: Create a copy of a section of an array
---

## Basics

- Creates a shallow copy
  <Callout
    type='error'
    title='Be Careful!'
  >
    Shallow copies still references the original array, so if the sliced array
    or the original are modified, the other will be modified as well
  </Callout>
- Takes in the start and end indices of which you want to extract out of the original array
- Start follows a 0 based index
- The end value also follows a 0 based index, but negative values start counting from the end
- This means that -1 doesn't point to the last element, rather it points to the second last
- If you want to slice to the last element, don't put an end argument

## Usage

```js
const animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant'];

console.log(animals.slice(2));
// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

console.log(animals.slice(2, 4));
// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

console.log(animals.slice(1, 5));
// Expected output: Array ["bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]

console.log(animals.slice(-2));
// Expected output: Array ["duck", "elephant"]

console.log(animals.slice(2, -1));
// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

console.log(animals.slice());
// Expected output: Array ["ant", "bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]
```
