title: shift()
description: Remove the first element from an array
---

## Basics

- Simply removes the first element of the array
- Returns that removed element

## Usage

```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];

const firstElement = array1.shift();

console.log(array1);
// Expected output: Array [2, 3]

console.log(firstElement);
// Expected output: 1
```

## Quirks

<Callout title='What if there is no element to remove?'>
  If the length of the array is 0, nothing is mutated, and undefined is returned
</Callout>
